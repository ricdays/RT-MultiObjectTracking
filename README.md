## Abstract

An accurate representation of the environment is very important for any robotic system that has to interact with its surroundings. Detection and tracking of multiple moving objects are particularly important if the environment is highly dynamic: the ability to correctly estimate the state of these objects around the robot can help it to anticipate its actions consequences, plan ahead and thus improve the overall efficiency.
One of the main challenges concerns a trade-off between accuracy and performance, which is automatically imposed when dealing with applications defined by real-time constraints.
Furthermore, when dealing with Multi-Agent Systems, the development of mechanisms to form a better world model by merging information from different agents is also one of the main research goals.

% what does this paper bring?
This paper presents a real-time compliant multi-object tracking solution for multi-agent systems that operate on stochastic and highly dynamic environments, using information gathered by various agents over time.
Although not limited to this specific application domain, the implementation and evaluation of this solution were performed on a team of autonomous soccer-playing robots.
The proposed solution is detailed from the detection and feature extraction phase to the general problem of efficiently tracking objects in the environment. Promising results have been achieved on the real testbed, with improvements on global object perception, which are also presented and discussed.
